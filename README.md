## Super Store Sales Dashboard – Exploratory Sales Analysis & Visualization

# Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Super Store Sales Dashboard designed to analyze sales performance, profitability, customer demand, and logistics efficiency across multiple regions in the United States. The objective was to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights that support strategic decision-making.
The dashboard provides a consolidated view of sales trends, profit metrics, product performance, geographic distribution, and shipping behavior, enabling stakeholders to quickly identify growth drivers and operational bottlenecks.


# Business Questions Addressed

•	What is the overall sales and profit performance of the store?

•	Which product categories and cities generate the highest revenue?

•	How are sales distributed geographically across states and regions?

•	What shipping modes are most frequently used, and how efficient are deliveries?

•	How do sales fluctuate month-to-month, and when do peak sales occur?



# Key Insights

•	Total Sales: $1.92M with a Profit Margin of 12%, indicating moderate profitability.

•	Top Performing Products: Office Machines emerged as the highest revenue-generating category. Chairs, telephones, and tables also contributed significantly to total sales.

•	Top Performing Cities: Los Angeles and New York City lead in total sales, highlighting strong urban demand.

•	Shipping Analysis: Regular Air accounts for 74% of all orders, making it the dominant shipping mode. Most orders were delivered within 2 days, indicating efficient logistics operations.

•	Geographic Distribution: Sales are concentrated in specific high-performing states, with clear regional disparities.

•	Monthly Trend: April recorded the highest sales ($389.8K), suggesting seasonal demand patterns worth further investigation.
